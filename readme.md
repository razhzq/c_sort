An attemp to rebuild the sort() function of javascript in C. 

I am well comfortable with javascript and I thought it could be fun to reproduce the behaviour JS sort() function in C. 

The things that I will cover for this C Sort library. 
Ascending & Descending:
- Array of Integers
- Array of Strings
